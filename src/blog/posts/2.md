Focus: Performance

1. Remove twitter feed from home page

   - This feed was full of images and required loading an extra script.

2. Avoid excessive DOM nodes (before: 1400, after: xxxx)

   - Made use of React Fragments to remove div wrappers in components
   - Will look to refactor components in the future to eliminate extra nodes
