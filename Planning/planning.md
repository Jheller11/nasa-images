## Tasks

1.  fix enhanced/natural images in epic.

    - fetch all images on component mount so only two calls to API are needed

2.  create controls for playing video back.

    - need to put all image elements into state instead of just data?

3.  expand testing (most components)

4.  refactor/comment all

5.  create new "about" component - DRY - future adding of new sources
